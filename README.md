# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

Developed a deep learning model to forecast stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks trained on historical market data. Implemented time-series preprocessing, feature scaling, and sequence generation to capture temporal dependencies. Optimized the LSTM architecture with dropout regularization and tuned hyperparameters to minimize RMSE, achieving accurate short-term price trend predictions.
